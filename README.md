## Authorship

The R materials used in Days 1 and 2 are based on the [Intro to R workshop](https://github.com/nuitrcs/r_intro_june2018) from NUIT Research Computing Services, created by Christina Maimone. They have been expanded and modified by Kumar Ramanathan and Richard Morel, the instructors for the R sessions during Days 1 and 2 respectively. The materials for Day 3 are original and have been developed by Richard Morel, Ali Ehlen, and Kumar Ramanathan, who are the joint instructors for Day 3.
